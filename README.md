# idearchy

This project is now live at [idearchy.com](https://idearchy.com)

'idearchy' is a personal project by Tim Adamson. The initial idea was to create a social media site similar to twitter, but instead of a like button a "This changed my mind" button incentivized competitive debate.

The tree diagram style visualizes the flow of debate differently. This could show how a single idea often spawns numerous responses and there is not a single solution to a particular problem.

### Technology

idearchy is built with React on the front-end, which consumes a .NET Core Web API. There is also an Azure SQL database which stores the tree data. All of these component are hosted on Azure.
